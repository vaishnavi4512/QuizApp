The Simple Quiz App is an interactive, responsive, and beginner-friendly web application designed to help users test their basic knowledge of web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Built using only front-end technologies—HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—this quiz app showcases how to create a real-time question-and-answer interface without relying on any backend or database.

This project is ideal for students, beginners in web development, and educators who wish to demonstrate how interactive web applications work using core web technologies. It’s styled with custom CSS for a sleek, modern appearance and includes user feedback mechanisms like color changes for correct/incorrect answers.
